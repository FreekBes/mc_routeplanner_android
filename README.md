# mc_routeplanner_android
A routeplanner for my Minecraft Realm. [Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.freekb.mc.android)!

The server-side code, including the code that actually calculates the routes and a working in-browser version, is available in [mc_routeplanner](https://github.com/FreekBes/mc_routeplanner) itself.
