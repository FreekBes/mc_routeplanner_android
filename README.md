# mc_routeplanner_android
A routeplanner for my Minecraft Realm. The server-side code, including the code that actually calculates the routes and a working in-browser version, is available in [mc_routeplanner](https://github.com/FreekBes/mc_routeplanner) itself.

I'm planning on publishing this app onto the Google Play Store in the future, which will be a first for me.
